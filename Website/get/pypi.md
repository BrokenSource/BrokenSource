!!! abstract ""
    === ":simple-python: Pip"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m pip install {package}
        ```

    === ":simple-poetry: Poetry"
        ```shell title="Command"
        python -m poetry add {package}
        ```

    === ":simple-rye: Rye"
        ```shell title="Command"

        ```

    === ":simple-pdm: PDM"
        ```shell title="Command"
        pdm add {package}
        ```

    ...where **`{package}`** is the **name of the project** you want to install:

    - [`depthflow`](https://pypi.org/project/depthflow/), [`shaderflow`](https://pypi.org/project/shaderflow/), [`broken-source`](https://pypi.org/project/broken-source/), [`pianola`](https://pypi.org/project/pianola/), [`spectronote`](https://pypi.org/project/spectronote/), [`turbopipe`](https://pypi.org/project/turbopipe/)

    <hr>

    ‚úÖ Preferably pin the package version `==x.y.z` on `pyproject.toml` for stability!

??? warning "A **Python 64 bits** interpreter is required"
    **Reason**: Some or many dependencies don't have precompiled wheels or will fail to compile for 32 bits[^1]

    - ‚úÖ Check your installation with: `python -c "import struct; print(struct.calcsize('P') * 8)"`
    - This is specially important on **Windows** as [**python.org**](https://www.python.org/) front page might link to 32 bit versions

    [^1]: Most notably `imgui`, and moderate chance of issues with `torch`, `numpy`, etc.

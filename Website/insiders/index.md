!!! warning "**No meaningful content exists yet.** I am sketching ideas and the website structure!"

Very briefly, the **Insiders** program will be a way to {++support the development of the software,++} while getting {++early access to new features, projects, premium content, and more++}. Most certainly it'll contain commercial-ready and content-farms tools for you to exploit!

> This **will not cannibalize any of the other projects into the "open-core" realm** or limit their features. The idea is to join the cumulative work of most projects into something greater, that is too good for commercial exploit to be a freebie, while also returning loss-leader features to the community as a whole.

It will only be available to [**GitHub Sponsors**](site:/about/sponsors), starting at a modest entry level, and building up in progressive commercial usage terms. The code will be Open Source, but no distribution rights will be granted, that is, only for personal or private use. You will evidently lose access to new features and the license to use it if you leave the program.

:material-arrow-right: This is also known as _sponsorware!_

Features may include (not a promise):

- Auto-lyrics generation and synchronization integrated with **ShaderFlow**; where one can automate long form or shorts videos with beautiful visualizations.

- Integration of **DepthFlow** as a background for music visualizers, just as seen on the **ShaderFlow** project readme, truly an unique application!

- Premium music visualizers shaders with _'modular'_ components (chosing particles, music bars, progress bars, etc), highly customizable and easy to use.

- Full pipeline for automated video generation from scratch using AI: automatic theme and scripts, video fillers, text to speech or music outputs (I have done it before lol).

- Newer projects, such as a smooth livestream chat visualizer for archiving or fun, a faster low-memory alternative of auto-editor, and others I forgot!

!!! quote "When will it be available?"
    I have to overhaul some core parts of ShaderFlow to start the work on the music visualizers and text support. Don't have any ETA yet, and I might start some work in auto-editor's killer first. Stay tuned!

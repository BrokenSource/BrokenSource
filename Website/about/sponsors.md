Hi, I'm [**Gabriel**](https://github.com/Tremeschin){:target="_blank"}, born and currently living in **Brazil üáßüá∑**

While my major is **electrical engineering** - as I always loved applied maths, I've been developing **open source** software in most of my free time ever since 2020. In fact, I've got so good at it, that following the engineering career path would be a {==wasted potential==}.

> :material-arrow-right: **I'm still early in life**. This work is what's left of me that didn't get lost in the way; I don't plan on stopping anytime, truly I'm overwhelmed with ideas and new projects to work on!

You might have noticed the incompatibility of _"free software"_ and _"career"_. Companies often promote *"open source [loss leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader){:target="_blank"}"* projects that doesn't hurt their main revenue and gain customers, while community projects are funded by the community itself, which is my case.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è I would 100% heartwarmingly do all of this for free, but your support lets me keep going!

This might be impostor syndrome, but it's hard for me to comprehend _"value"_ in people's work per my philosophy of openness. Ultimately, I'm asking for the society's permission to keep doing this and have a life out of it; I'm modest and humble, will never flaunt or boast.

_**You** are the society deciding if I can do this for a living!_

### Why to support?

- ‚ôªÔ∏è I have spend an **uncountable** number of hours on the Projects as a whole, in a year's journey of learning, improving on self-taught programming skills, math knowledge, and problem solving. You already get all that for {++free++}, and help on keeping it going, improving, maintaining, offering technical support, and more by supporting my work!
> Think how much a full team would cost to develop and maintain such a software..

- ‚ú® It allows me to **improve** the software in many **platforms**[^platforms], by buying hardware and gadgets to test and implement new features, as well as paying for self-hosting services {>>(eventually)<<}, domain names, workstation environment, and other expenses.

[^platforms]: Most notably supporting **Apple Silicon** without having the hardware to test on isn't ideal, as well as **Hybrid GPUs** systems often found in laptops, which could receive some upstream improvements.

- üáßüá∑ This may appear naive, but my local currency and average income is so weak, that 100$ american dollars already is **50%** of the minimum monthly wage here. This is a value you'd spend on a two's dinner! {>> Not making a point, just putting into perspective üòÖ <<}


### What you get?

Apart from the already existing exclusive features of the [**Insiders**](site:/insiders){:target="_blank"} program, you'll get:

- üíé _**Prioritized** support and feature requests[^features]:_ You have shown to value my time. I'd help everyone individually if possible, but I have to prioritize living, coding and additionally providing technical support on problems _you_ might face or features _you'd_ want!

[^features]: This isn't a guarantee, and I might not approve or put a bounty in your request; but I'll certainly consider it!

- üí¨ _**Discord** roles:_ Get access to many members-only channels where I commit to participate at a greater general availability. I can help from simple to complex stuff

<small>:material-arrow-right: **Insiders** only:</small>

- ‚≠êÔ∏è _**Early access** to new features:_ You'll get to test new features before they're released to the public, and provide feedback on them. This might include new ShaderFlow modules, new integrations, even new projects I'm working on!

- üì¶ _**Exclusive content**:_ Better explained in the [**Insiders**](site:/insiders){:target="_blank"} page itself; this might include premium ShaderFlow scenes, automated video farm tools, custom scripts for you.

- üåµ _[**Bounties**](#bounty-hunting) program_: Contribute to target supporting goals for features to be available for all the community or for the development to start!

<br>

## üé© Bounty Hunting

!!! warning "This is work in progress, haven't decided the mechanisms or prices yet."

There are lots of ideas that I'd like to implement, but haven't had the time, interest or resources to do so. As such, I'm doing a **bounties** program, where you can contribute to a specific goal, and once it's reached, I'll start work on it!

<small><b>Note:</b> This list is subject to change; achieving such goals may take some time or be unpractical to implement, which can only be seen after starting the work. As such, I'll do my best to keep feasible, self-judged goals here.</small>

- [ ] Offline portable binary releases [**DepthFlow #54**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/DepthFlow/issues/54){:target="_blank"}

- [ ] Text rendering module in ShaderFlow, allowing for lyrics, subtitles, and more.

#### Low priority

- [ ] Continue the development of [**SpectroNote #1**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/SpectroNote/issues/1){:target="_blank"}

- [ ] Better spectrograms with Reassignment method [**SpectroNote #2**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/SpectroNote/issues/2){:target="_blank"}

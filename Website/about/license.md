## The Software

All projects have their own licenses. Most of the time, code is [**AGPLv3**](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0){:target="_blank"} and art [**CC BY-SA 4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en){:target="_blank"}, but you must always look at the project's repository and website page for proper details!

- **This page's** contents are {--_a custom licensing model_--} {++‚úÖ fair encouragements++}
- **I only ask** to not abuse my years of work, {++‚úÖ let's grow together++}
- **For my integrity**[^integrity], I may change this page at any time

[^integrity]: For protecting users and improving the model, so it's more sustainable for both sides.

### üî¥ Personal use
There are **no restrictions** on **private** use of any Software. {>>(family, friends, you)<<}

- No strings attached! It's [**free and open source software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"}.
- Be creative and have fun, study and modify as you like.

!!! note "**Note:** Monetizing online content counts as [**commercial use**](#commercial-use)."

<hr>

### üü° Commercial use
<div class="annotate" markdown>
**Here's the dilema:** {==If I were against commercial use, I wouldn't use it myself as a user==}

- **My mission is to empower you**, and make awesome tools to the world.
- It is my desire and goal for you to use the tools commercially.

!!! heart annotate "Fairness makes the difference"
    ‚ú® **If you valued** my work, [**donate**](site:about/sponsors){:target="_blank"} an amount that reflects how much it was **essential to your success** ‚ú®

    - These tools took years to learn and develop; and always ongoing improvements and maintenance
    - **Remember**: I provide professional, high quality tools for free (1)

1.  You have **locally run, free alternatives** for:
    - Services like [**ImmersityAI**](https://www.immersity.ai/){:target="_blank"}: $0.50 per video
    - Services like [**Specterr**](https://specterr.com/pricing/){:target="_blank"}: $75.00 per month
    - [**Synthesia**](https://synthesiagame.com/){:target="_blank"}: One time $40.00 payment

### üü¢ Business use
**Interested** in powering your current or future business, need support in anything?

- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Join Forces**: I miss the infra and marketing, {++you now have the product++}

## Code license

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Community

The community license of choice is the **AGPLv3**. It's a strong copyleft[^copyleft] license that ensures the software remains forever open source and free for all users ‚Ä¢ commercial use is allowed.

[^copyleft]: It's the opposite of _copyright!_ ba dum tss üòÖ

> You already have the rights of this license, no need to ask for permission!

This choice can be controversial, here's my thoughts:

- It can be a blocker for some businesses, for that, there's a [**commercial license**](#commercial-license) available.
- The GPLv3 part is often well-accepted, even though both are nearly identical licenses. This is mostly for preventing abuse of the work, read more [**below**](#commercial-license).
- ShaderFlow and derived projects can easily be hosted as a **SaaS**. The "Affero" clause ensures no bad actors can take advantage of the software without contributing back.

I plan on re-licensing to MIT in the future ‚Ä¢ the [**contributions**](#contributions) terms are a step towards that.

- [**Support**](site:/about/sponsors) my work to achieve that faster! I believe the projects can be successful and sustainable in the future, just unsure on the amount of support in this early era üòÖ
- Some of my projects like [**TurboPipe**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/TurboPipe) are under MIT, and I use many packages under it!


### ‚≠êÔ∏è Commercial

> **Note**: The commercial license is about **non-AGPL** use of the software. The community license allows usage for **any purpose**, including commercial ‚Ä¢ read more [above](#community-license).

Certain projects are dual-licensed under a [**Community**](#community-license) and a **Commercial (MIT)** license.

The community license will forever be available for free and by default, while the commercial license is available under custom agreements, often, but not always, for a fee[^fee].

[^fee]: Either a fixed recurring amount or a fraction of what you yould've paid for a competitor's service.

As far as I know, the terms here superseed the ones in the MIT you're getting. I'm trusting for your honesty and fairness to respect the terms here being a private user. It is in both of our interests to have a sustainable relationship and loyalty moving forward.

The main reasons for this model are:

- The commercial license **does not** adds any restrictions, in fact, it adds **more rights** to what the community license already sets as a baseline for interested parties.
- A significant amount of open source projects have fallen to their own permissivity by the hands of corporations or individuals, without retributing patches or monetary support:
    - Giving it for free is [**altruistic and noble**](site:/about/sponsors), there's nothing wrong in selling one's work.
    - Dual-licensing allows interested parties to still use the software permissively, while _forcing_ them to return the interest as investment to further development.

The general terms, unless agreed otherwise, are:

- I'll grant you technical support and updates for the software, including, but not limited to custom functionality, integrations, compatibility, let my general availability allow it.
- No relicensing or sublicensing: Your rights are exclusive and non-transferable by default.
- Distribution is relicensing: Your users must (in)directly have this commercial license. You can be a proxy on their behalf; I'm open to discuss the mechanisms and terms.
- I may terminate the agreement at any time in case of non-compliance with a 30 days notice. In such cases, you don't retain the rights to use the "last permitted version" and must cease usage, or switch to the community license and non-custom written code.

In the future, I plan on relicensing to MIT. This might seem hypocritical given the last  few statements, but I've seen in practice some very successful projects under MIT, just unsure on support level I will receive üòÖ ‚Ä¢ maybe the [**Insiders**](site:/insiders) program can out-pace it.

## Contributions

> By contributing to any project within this organization, you grant all rights to your submissions, including permission to incorporate and use them as part of the projects under any applicable licenses. For agreeing, check the box when submitting pull requests that you have read and agree to this Contributor License Agreement.

I know CLAs are discouraging and can cause trust issues regarding being a maneuver tool for moving to a proprietary or source available models. Instead of writing a _manifesto_ about how I'm not going to do that, you have seen my actions and can have my word on it.

> <small>**Note**: I can't guarantee integrity if one comes with an irrecusable[^irrecusable] offer to buy the work. If that happens, the last versions will be relicensed to MIT, then I change niches and [take on farming](https://github.com/dylanaraps) üöú</small>

[^irrecusable]: I bet you also have your own magic number in mind of how much life's worth.

There's some good reasons of why I want to do so:

- No contribution will easily outweight the current work; by the time someone's submitting such contributions, they'll already be part of the team and receive monetary support.
- The code base is very complex and took years to develop on my own. It doesn't feel fair to lock it to **AGPLv3**, making it hard[^hard] to transition to **MIT** in the future.
- Having full rights to the code-base gives me strong governance to prevent abuse from happening: choosing the right and/or well-minded partners for [**private**](#commercial-license) use under the commercial license, while also getting funding to continue the work.

[^hard]: Each contributor would need to agree re-licensing their contributions.

Call me out if I ever diverge, and I'll make it right.

## User content

Most projects generates audiovisual content, either procedurally or based on user inputs, in the form of videos, images and/or audio. The user is responsible for all content generated by the software, local or remote, and must adhere to the following guidelines.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Rights**: The user must ensure having the rights to use any third-party assets, including images, videos, audio, etc. External laws and licenses apply.
- **Attribution**: If the software generates content based on third-party assets direct or indirectly, the user must ensure proper attribution is given if required.
    - Always read the author's license on source code files you're executing and/or the project's one for more information. By default, I use [**CC BY-SA 4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en){:target="_blank"} for the shaders[^shaders].
- **Illegal**: The user must not use the software to generate illegal content defined by their jurisdiction, including but not limited to pirated content, general targeted violence.

[^shaders]: The generated content from projects like **DepthFlow**, **Pianola**, **SpectroNote** falls under this license.

<hr>

## Community content

!!! quote "Work in Progress"
    Community work retain their rights on Shaders and Scenes (no affiliation), but must follow the Community license if they are widely used or distributed; encourage them to incorporate as a official demo or on the Community scenes repository; amazing works to be qualified for a partnership program.

<hr>

## Third Party

Projects may bundle **assets files** or download them at runtime.

Most notably:

- **Programs**: Like [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/), &nbsp;[**FluidSynth**](https://www.fluidsynth.org/), &nbsp;[**RealESRGAN**](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan), &nbsp;[**Waifu2x**](https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan)
- **Models**[^1]: Such as [**DepthAnything**](https://depth-anything.github.io/), &nbsp;[**Marigold**](https://marigoldmonodepth.github.io/), &nbsp;[**ZoeDepth**](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth)
- **Soundfonts**:
- **Fonts**: [**DejaVu Fonts**](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)

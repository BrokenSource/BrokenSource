!!! heart "Let's keep it simple, short and fair!"

All projects have their own licenses. Most of the time, code is [**AGPLv3**](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0){:target="_blank"} and art [**CC BY-SA 4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en){:target="_blank"}, but you must always look at the project's repository and website page for proper details!

- **I only ask** to not abuse my years of work, {++✅ let's grow together++}
- **For my integrity**[^integrity], I may change this page at any time

[^integrity]: For protecting users and improving the model, so it's more sustainable for both sides.

## Usage

### 🔴 Personal
There are **no restrictions** on **private** use of any Software. {>>(personal projects, friends)<<}

- No strings attached! It's [**free and open source software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"}.
- Be creative and have fun, study and modify as you like.

!!! note "**Note:** Monetizing online content counts as [**commercial use**](#commercial-use)."

### 🟡 Commercial
<div class="annotate" markdown>
**Here's the dilema:** {==If I were against commercial use, I wouldn't use it myself as a user==}

- **My mission is to empower you**, and make awesome tools to the world.
- It is my desire and goal for you to use the tools commercially!

!!! heart annotate "Fairness makes the difference"
    ✨ **If you valued** my work, [**donate**](site:about/sponsors){:target="_blank"} an amount that reflects how much it was **essential to your success** ✨

    - These tools took years to learn and develop; and always ongoing improvements and maintenance
    - **Remember**: I provide professional, high quality tools for free (1)

1.  You have **locally run, free alternatives** for:
    - Services like [**ImmersityAI**](https://www.immersity.ai/){:target="_blank"}: $0.50 per video
    - Services like [**Specterr**](https://specterr.com/pricing/){:target="_blank"}: $75.00 per month
    - [**Synthesia**](https://synthesiagame.com/){:target="_blank"}: One time $40.00 payment


### 🟢 Business
**Interested** in powering your current or future business, need support in anything?

## Code license

The license of choice is the [**AGPLv3**](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0){:target="_blank"}. It's a strong copyleft[^copyleft] license that ensures the software remains **free and open source** for all users • commercial use is allowed.

[^copyleft]: It's the opposite of _copyright!_ ba dum tss 😅

> :material-arrow-right: **You already** have the rights of this license, no need to ask for permission!

This choice can be controversial, here's my thoughts:

- The GPLv3 part is often well-accepted, even though both are nearly identical licenses.
- ShaderFlow and derived projects can easily be hosted as a **SaaS**. The "Affero" clause ensures no bad actors can take advantage of the software without contributing back.
- It can be a blocker for some businesses, for that,

**I plan on relicensing to [MIT](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license){:target="_blank"} in the future**, the [**contributions**](#contributions) terms are a step towards that.

- Some of my projects like [**TurboPipe**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/TurboPipe) are under **MIT**, and I use many packages under it!
- [**Support**](site:/about/sponsors) my work to achieve that faster, I believe the projects can be successful and sustainable in the future, just unsure on the amount of support in this early era 😅

## Contributions

> By contributing to any project within this organization, you grant all rights to your submissions, including permission to incorporate and use them as part of the projects under any applicable licenses. For agreeing, check the box when submitting pull requests that you have read and agree to this Contributor License Agreement.

I know CLAs are discouraging and can cause trust issues regarding being a maneuver tool for moving to a proprietary or source available models. Instead of writing a _manifesto_ about how I'm not going to do that, you have seen my actions and can have my word on it.

> <small>**Note**: I can't guarantee integrity if one comes with an irrecusable offer to buy the work</small>

There's some good reasons of why I want to do so:

- No contribution will easily outweight the current work; by the time someone's submitting such contributions, they'll already be part of the team and receive monetary support.
- The code base is very complex and took years to develop on my own. It doesn't feel fair to lock it to **AGPLv3**, making it hard[^hard] to transition to **MIT** in the future.
- Having full rights to the code-base gives me strong governance to prevent abuse from happening: choosing the right and/or well-minded partners for private use, while also getting funding to continue the work.

[^hard]: Each contributor would need to agree re-licensing their contributions.

:material-arrow-right: Call me out if I ever diverge, and I'll make it right.

## User content

Most projects generates audiovisual content, either procedurally or based on user inputs, in the form of videos, images and/or audio. The user is responsible for all content generated by the software, local or remote, and must adhere to the following guidelines.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Rights**: The user must ensure having the rights to use any third-party assets, including images, videos, audio, etc. External laws and licenses apply.
- **Attribution**: If the software generates content based on third-party assets direct or indirectly, the user must ensure proper attribution is given if required.
    - Always read the author's license on source code files you're executing and/or the project's one for more information. By default, I use [**CC BY-SA 4.0**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en){:target="_blank"} for the shaders[^shaders].
- **Illegal**: The user must not use the software to generate illegal content defined by their jurisdiction, including but not limited to pirated content, general targeted violence.

[^shaders]: The generated content from projects like **DepthFlow**, **Pianola**, **SpectroNote** falls under this license.

<hr>

## Community content

!!! quote "Work in Progress"
    Community work retain their rights on Shaders and Scenes (no affiliation), but must follow the Community license if they are widely used or distributed; encourage them to incorporate as a official demo or on the Community scenes repository; amazing works to be qualified for a partnership program.

<hr>

## Third Party

Projects may bundle **assets files** or download them at runtime.

Most notably:

- **Programs**: Like [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/), &nbsp;[**FluidSynth**](https://www.fluidsynth.org/), &nbsp;[**RealESRGAN**](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan), &nbsp;[**Waifu2x**](https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan)
- **Models**[^1]: Such as [**DepthAnything**](https://depth-anything.github.io/), &nbsp;[**Marigold**](https://marigoldmonodepth.github.io/), &nbsp;[**ZoeDepth**](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth)
- **Soundfonts**:
- **Fonts**: [**DejaVu Fonts**](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)

# ðŸŒŸ Contributing

!!! warning "This page will be improved later, until then, it's best to [get in touch](site:/about/contact) directly"

<b><span class="the">O</span>pen source</b> development is a complex balance of vision and collaboration. While the projects have a clear direction and momentum, meaningful contributions can help make them more robust and valuable for everyone.

:material-arrow-right: The main areas where you can contribute are:

- **ðŸ“š Documentation**: I need to focus on what matters the most, the code. The website is often a side-work and a place I don't, *vaguely speaking*, use [#](#documentation)
- **ðŸ§ª Testing**: While common or intended use cases are covered when developing, I can only test so much of it and on the available hardware and systems I have [#](#testing)
- **ðŸŽ¨ Design**: Proper logos, banners, art for the projects [#](#design)
- **ðŸŽ¬ Creations**: Show off your work and inspire others [#](#showcase)
- **ðŸ’» Code**: Improvements on the code itself [#](#code)

Always evolving code, a wisdom rabbit hole to know the ins and outs of the system as a whole. I could only hope to ever have it all properly documented, as the focus is always on the code itself.

- This readme is intentionally vague in a sense, as there's just too much going on. Instead of talking about everything and nothing at the same time, go exploring the self-documented codebase!
- Feel free to get in touch to learn how it works or python monorepos advice.


## 📦 Structure

Roughly speaking, the important parts are:

### ♻️ Common

- [`📁/.github`](../.github): Workflows, readmes + [special](https://github.com/BrokenSource/.github) organization repository
- [`📁/website`](../website): Mkdocs documentation [`mkdocs-base.yml`](../mkdocs-base.yml)

### 🗿 Monorepo

- [`📁/docker`](../docker): Everything docker for all projects
- `📁/meta`: Optional directory to link off-branch projects
- [`📁/projects`](../projects): Application projects (has entry points)
- [`action.yml`](../action.yml): Setup workflow

### 🐍 Python

- `📁/.venv`: Global venv from [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [`📁/broken`](../broken): Main shared library
- `📁/dist`: Common build directory
- [`📁/packages`](../packages): Library projects

### 🦀 Rust

- [`📁/crates`](../crates): Library projects
- `📁/target`: Build directory


## 💡 Tips

- Export `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/__pycache__` in `/etc/environment` to avoid `*.pyc` clutter
- Always run `uv sync --all-packages` or `uv sync --package (name)` for select python
- Use `docker compose run --rm --build (service)` from [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml)
